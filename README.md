# custom-ls
Custom ls -l command 

The program will take in file names as command line arguments, and display the file information if the file is in the current directory. If no file name is provided, the program will display the file information of all files in the current directory. 

The file information displayed is similar to the information displayed in the Bash built-in ls -l command.
